      <description>Gaviâ€™s COVAX Advance Market Commitment
  On 10 June, 2021 President Joe Biden announced that United States will donate 500 million Pfizer vaccines to 92 low- and lower middle-income countries and economies.
  The vaccine maker Pfizer has got the order from the government. The pandemic has been profitable for the pharma sector and Pfizer has also added huge amounts to its valuation.
  It would be interesting to compare the market value of Pfizer with the GDP of countries that will be getting the benefits of free vaccines by U.</description>

      <description>The Fortune 500
  When it comes to market capitalization/value the top 4-5 companies on the list of Fortune 500 hold a significant share in the market.
  For studying this I have gathered data from the official website of Fortune.
  After that I have used Power BI for making visualization, that shows the market value of top 25 Fortune 500 companies for 2021.
   Top 25 companies as per market value    From the visualizations we can observe that the top 4 companies Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet(Google) have a combined market share of nearly 46% of the total market capitalization of top 25 companies.</description>

  This is the &amp;ldquo;expected goals model&amp;rdquo; (a product of data analytics), which essentially tells us what are the probabilities of goal being scored from a certain area on the field.
   The expected goals curve     I have taken data from La Liga season 2006-07 and 2018-19</description>
